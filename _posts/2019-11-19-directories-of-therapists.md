Finding a therapist in your area, that you can afford and is taking patients, can sometimes be difficult. Here are a few websites with good, comprehensive listing that can help in your search.

You can also ask your doctor for a referral. They likely know the therapists available in the area, and can help you find one that will meet your needs.

- **[Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)** provides one of the most comprehensive listings of therapists in the US and Canada. After you search by location, a menu on the left gives you the options to further narrow your results.
- **[The National Register of Health Service Psychologists](http://www.nationalregister.com/find)** has fewer therapists than Psychology Today, but is still one of the largest directories available.
- **[The Academy of Cognitive Therapy](https://www.academyofct.org)** lists therapists who are members of this Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) trade organization. [Learn more about CBT](https://blog.uplift.app/what-is-cbt)
- **[The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies](http://www.findcbt.org/xFAT/index.cfm)** likewise lists therapists who are CBT-practicing members of its organization.
- **[SAMSHA.gov](https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov)** lists mental-healthcare providers maintained by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The list is quite broad, and has everything from psychiatrists to substance-abuse clinics. It also provides information about whether most providers accept Medicaid. They also offer this information via phone: 1-800-662-HELP (4357).
